# === 🧠 Chapter 5: Make Decisions (if/else) ===
# 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING: if / else logic
# 🤔 WHY: Your program can make choices based on what the user types
# 💻 WHAT IT DOES: Only one block runs depending on the answer
 
# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK
# door = input("Pick a door (1 or 2): ")
# if door == "1":
#     print("🎉 You found treasure!")
# else:
#     print("💀 Uh-oh, it's a trap!")
 
# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK

# if cat_person == "yes":
#     print("Meow 🐱")
# else:
#     print("That's okay — dogs are cool too!")
 
# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK
# color = input("Guess my favorite color: ")
# if color == "blue":
#     print("Correct! 💙")
# else:
#     print("Nope, it's not", color)
 
# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK

# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK
# pet = input("Choose a pet: dragon or bunny? ")
# if pet == "dragon":
#     print("🔥 You soar into the clouds!")
# else:
#     print("🐇 Your bunny snuggles into your backpack.")
 
 
# === 🏆 Chapter 6: Final Boss Challenge ===
# 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING: Building a real mini-story with code
# 🤔 WHY: This brings everything together — print, input, and if/else
# 💻 WHAT IT DOES: You’re the storyteller. The user plays along!
 
# 🔓 UNCOMMENT THIS BLOCK
# print("You stand before the gates of the Shadow Castle.")
# password = input("Speak the password to enter: ")
# if password == "open123":
#     print("🗝️ The gates creak open. You may enter!")
# else:
#     print("🚫 WRONG! The castle remains locked.")
 
# 🧠 BONUS CHALLENGE:
# Make your own little interactive scene!
# Some fun ideas:
# - Ask “Do you eat tacos?” and print a silly reaction
# - Ask “What’s 2 + 2?” and check their answer
# - Ask “Pick a weapon: sword or wand?” and react differently
# Write your code here:
 
# Example:
# weapon = input("Choose your weapon (sword or wand): ")
# if weapon == "sword":
#     print("🗡️ You slash through the vines!")
# else:
#     print("✨ You cast a glowing light spell!")
 
 
# === 🏁 QUEST COMPLETE ===
# ✅ Save this file: python_magic.py
# ✅ Push it to GitHub: Coding2025/<YourName>/python_magic.py
# ✅ Check GitHub.com to confirm it uploaded
# ✅ 📩 Message Sachin sir and let him know you're done!
